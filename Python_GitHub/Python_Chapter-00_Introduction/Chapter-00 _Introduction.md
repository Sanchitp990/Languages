1. Dynamic typed languages :-

>  **_In dynamic typed languages, the type of a variable can change at runtime. This means that you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you create it. For example, in Python:_**

**code 1**
```python 
x = 5  # x is inferred to be an integer
print(x)
x = "hello"  # now x is inferred to be a string
print(x)
```

2. Statically typed languages :-

> **_Statically typed languages are languages in which the type of a variable is explicitly declared and cannot change. In languages like Java, C++, and C#, you must specify the data type of a variable when you declare it. For example, in Java:_**


**code 2**
```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 5; // x is explicitly declared as an integer
    String message = "hello"; // message is explicitly declared as a string
    System.out.println(x);
    System.out.println(message);
  }
}
```

## Difference between Python and Java

| Python                                   | Java                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Interpreted language                  | 1. Compiled language                               |
| 2. Emphasizes simplicity and readability | 2. Emphasizes object-oriented programming          |
| 3. Dynamic typing                        | 3. Static typing                                   |
| 4. Extensive standard library            | 4. Platform-independent (write once, run anywhere) |

### Code Difference between Python and Java

Here are the difference between python and java codes

In Python:

---
**code 3**
```Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

And in Java:

**code 4**
```Java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```
---

So, you can clearly see that difference between Java and Python to print "Hello, world!". 

The line in python to print hello world needs only 1 line but in case of java it completely change to print hello world in java we need more than 1 line as you can see in above code 4.


### Python 

Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by _**Guido van Rossum**_ and was first released in 1991.


Python is widely used for :-

- web development,
- data analysis,
- artificial intelligence, and more.

## Features of Python

In python features we cover only 3 main features of Python :
